# About
This repository hosts a GUI created with PyQt  for the creation of a velocity vector map.

This was my first experience with Python, Qt and Object-Oriented Programming.
I was trying to experiment with as many features as possible and that is the reason I 
implemented a video splashscreen, the “help” tab, etc. 


# Dependencies
The code needs a .txt file of 5 columns: x y vx vy v. The x and y are the coordinates and vx, vy are the components of velocity v (attached “00_20180222_20180316_FreeJet_20mbar_LOAD_remove_manual.txt”)
The desired .txt file must first be selected and then “Plot” button must be clicked in order for the vectormap to be visualized.
